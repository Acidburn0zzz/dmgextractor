- Parser overhaul, reducing memory footprint and working with streams/readers instead of
  arrays when getting results from the parser.

Changes between 0.5 and 0.51pre1
--------------------------------

- Switched XML-parser to a homebrew parser after getting frustrated with not being able
  to turn off the SAX parser's inability to work in offline conditions, just because it
  needed to contact www.apple.com every single time to get a DTD.
  If my own XML parser bugs out, you can always supply the switch -saxparser to the command
  line to use the SAX parser.
- Worked further on compatibility issues... discovered a new block type which supposedly
  also means zero fill... at least in the cases I tested. The new version should be more
  compatible than the previous (I have no DMG images in my possession that it should handle
  and yet doesn't).
- Code cleanup started, but needs more work. It's a mess...
